# PRW3 - Activity Visualisation
_The objective of this project is to **self-quantifiy** and **interact** with our daily **activitiy data**._   
## Getting started :fire:
Simply open [index.html](index.html) in your browser.  
If you have the error `Failed to load... : Cross origin requests are only supported for ...`, use  
`python -m SimpleHTTPServer`.   
and then go to [http://localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000).  

If you don't have python, you can use the php alternative.  
`php -S localhost:8000`.  

If you don't have php, use the Firefox browser.
